        <h1>San Andres Islands</h1>
        <p>This quirky Caribbean Island leaves many first-time visitors perplexed. San Andres is an island paradise that belongs to Colombia, even though it's geographically closer to Nicaragua or Panama. <br>Then there's the fact that its residents don't speak Spanish but rather an English Creole. Of course, none of that really matters when you find yourself sunning <br>on the most stunning beaches under the Colombian flag. With its remote location, it can only be reached by air.</p>
        
        <h1>Attractions</h1>
        <p>San Andres is a must-visit Caribbean island. It has everything you're looking for in an island destination: palm trees, white-sand beaches, crystal clear water, <br> great weather and little islands surrounding it. On this island, you can find yourself amongst beautiful nature unlike anywhere else!</p>

        <div class="attractions">

                <h2>Johnny Cay Natural Regional Park</h2>
                <img src="./images/San-andres/Johnny cay natural regional park.jpeg" class="imgcities" alt="Johnny Cay Natural Regional Park">
            </div>
            <div class="textCities">Take a boat from the main beach in San Andrés out to this island of white sand beaches and coconut groves.
                Inhabited by lots of iguanas, the protected coral islet is wildly beautiful but it can get packed with tourists, especially on the weekends.
                <br>Lounge in the shade under a palm tree or head out to snorkel over the surrounding reef.
                <br>There are tons of little food and drink stalls here playing reggae music, try the Caribbean lobster, fried fish, or the coco loco (a fresh coconut with rum). Explore the interior of the island a bit or take a stroll around the whole thing in about 15 minutes.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="attractions">
            <div class="textCities">It's a popular sandbank where you can rent snorkeling gear and lockers, but there's not quite as much to see underwater as in other areas.
                Walk or swim from El Acuario to the nearby Haynes Cay for a much more secluded and relaxing experience.
                It's tiny with very little actual beach but it's one of the most beautiful cays in San Andrés.
                You'll only find clear waters, wild iguanas, and two tiny little restaurants, one of which (Bibi's Place) is delicious.</div>
            <div class="citiesPage">

            </div>
            <div class="textCities">Take a flight or book the three-hour catamaran trip to this unspoiled land where the pace of life is shower.
                Because it's tough to get here, there are fewer tourists and the traditional way of life remains in tact, with English creole still spoken in the villages.
                Travelers come for incredible Scuba diving, snorkeling, and hiking.
                Visit Crab Cay and McBean Lagoon National Park for beaches and then Peak Forestry Reserve for walking when you've had enough water-based activities.

        <div class="attractions">
            <div class="textCities">With some of the best beaches around, take a tour or hire a boat to this tiny little island encircled with palm trees and white sand.
            While it'll take a whole day to make this trip it's about 15 miles (25 kilometers) away a tour usually includes drinks and lunch as well as plenty of time to lounge in the sun.
            Because it's tough to get to, the island remains unspoiled with clear turquoise waters and plenty of fish, coral, and even baby sharks swimming about.

            </div>
            <div class="textCities">One of the best places for snorkeling from the shore on San Andrés, La Piscinita (also known as West View) is a popular spot with tourists for good reason.
                For a small entrance fee, you'll receive a piece of bread to feed the fish swimming about in the crystal clear waters.
                Grab your mask or rent one there, jump in from the diving board they've built over the sea, and watch as fish eat directly from your hand! There are other water activities that you can pay extra for like jet boat rides and aquanaut gear.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="attractions">
            <div class="textCities">For plant, flower, and gardening lovers, this is a must-visit attraction in San Andrés.
                The botanical gardens here are well maintained and tours are available to learn about the nature and history of the island, they last about an hour.
                Take a cool stroll through the trees, learn about the most important native plants of the island, and head to the top of the building for a view of the greenery of San Andrés and the ocean beyond.
                The facilities are modern, the paths and signage are clear, and you may even see some animals roaming around.

            <div class="textCities">This is a very small hole located on the southern shores and is usually quite a popular place to visit. At the El Hoyo Soplador blowhole, you'll also find some small rasta cafes and even a large restaurant. We visited during a popular time and there was a long line of Colombian tourists waiting for their turn to stand above the hole.</div>

        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>San Andres is a great destination for lovers of Scuba diving and snorkeling, plus you can take day trips out to explore nearby islands and fish for your lunch. Straight out of a postcard, <br> the brilliant blue-green water here has been given the nickname “the sea of seven colors.” The island was first explored by English Puritans, <br> and some of their legacy remains to this day in the island's houses, language, and neighborhood names.</p>

            <div class="textImgMedellin fade">
                <div>Scuba diving is one of the main reasons people venture all the way to the island of San Andrés. With incredible visibility and water warm enough that you don't even need a wetsuit, it's the perfect place to learn to dive or get in a couple of fun dives.
                    <br> There are colorful coral reefs, rock formations, tons of fish, sharks, and even bioluminescent plankton.</div>

                <div>The best way to explore San Andres Island is to rent a motorbike or Golf Cart. That's because the tiny Caribbean Island of San Andres covers an area of just 26 km² (10 sq mi). As a result, you can actually drive around the whole island in under an hour!

                    Along the beaches and cays, you'll find little restaurants selling whole fried fish with coconut rice and patacones (smashed and fried plantains), but some also do fresh ceviche well.</div>

                <div>If you've never done this, then this Colombian Caribbean island is one of the best places to try it, since it's super affordable (just $65 USD).

                    Most parasailing activities run on the east coast. This is perfect since it offers the best views of the Sea of 7 Colors!</div>
