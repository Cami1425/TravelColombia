        <div class="textCities">One of the most surprising things about Colombia for foreign visitors is the unchanging nature of its climate all year round. This is because the country is located on the Equator, which means the sun rises and sets at the same time all year round and the season stays the same, unlike almost every other country in the world. There are just the dry seasons (from December to January and July to August) and the rainy seasons (from April to May and October to November). However, this doesn't mean that the whole country gets the same weather. In fact, the topographical diversity of Colombia provides a huge variety of landscapes, biodiversity and thermal floors.<br>

        <div class="textCities">The Colombian peso is the country's legal tender. It is generally identified with the abbreviation COP, and you'll find that the official peso symbol ($) is used locally.
            A wide selection of banknotes and coins are used. You will find 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 peso coins and 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 peso banknotes, highlighting Colombia's wealth and diversity. Get to know them!<br>

        <div class="textCities">Music in Colombia, like most of the country's artistic manifestations, is influenced by Spanish, indigenous and African elements that formed that nation. This country has a great musical diversity, which is why it is known as the country of a thousand rhythms, with more than 1025 rhythms. This are some of the Colombian's rithms:<br> <br>

        <div class="textCities">Latin America is the next hot dining scene, and most of Colombia's culinary gems can be found in the capital of Bogotá. For the country's best food experience, it's best to embrace the extremes, from the high end to the casual and the healthy to the very, very deep fried. Yes, the city's nuevo Colombiano chefs are creating innovative mash-ups with traditional ingredients and imported techniques, but it's just as worthwhile to check out the array of street food as well.<br> Colombia is a relatively small country, but the food culture is remarkably dependent on geography.

            Bandeja Paisa, Sancocho, Empanadas, Arepas, Cuchuco<br><br>
            Are some of the dishes people can find in Colombia.<br><br>
