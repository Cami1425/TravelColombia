        <p>There is something that characterizes Colombia as the most welcoming country in the world, and that is its warmth.<br> A word that every Colombian carries in their hearts and that is synonymous with the people, with the most beautiful things in Colombia. <br>That warmth comes from his customs and traditions, from that instinct that leads him to always greet everyone who comes to his door with a smile and a good cup of coffee. <br>

            Colombian warmth means that throughout the country, in each of its regions, whoever arrives feels welcome, because regardless of the fact that they find different accents,<br> and as many ways of saying "friend" as there are a variety of climates, whoever receives becomes family and they are made to feel at home. <br><br>
            Here are some reviews coming from popular pages.</p>

She was great, very friendly and knowledgeable with loads of information both tourism oriented as well as historical. The day was well planned in advance with the taxis taking us up from the hotel and dropping us off at the foot of Montserrat. We then walked the rest of the day touring sites as well as having lunch and tasting local cuisine. We loved the tour and the experience. We recommend it to people visiting Bogota for the first time."</i><br>
